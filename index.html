    <h1>History</h1>
 	    <p>Pi Delta Psi Fraternity was founded by eleven men from various backgrounds (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino and Vietnamese). Already established leaders within their own university sponsored cultural organizations, these men assembled to devise a structure that would create an understanding between the various Asian cultures, build relationships extending beyond the academic years and most importantly, finding and building an individual's skill sets. These eleven men envisioned an infrastructure that would continuously motivate and challenge individuals. This infrastructure of a fraternal society, which has been around since 1776 would become the building blocks of their endeavor.
